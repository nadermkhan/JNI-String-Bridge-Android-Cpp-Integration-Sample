# JNI-String-Bridge-Android-Cpp-Integration-Sample
This project demonstrates how to retrieve a String from a native C++ shared library (.so) using JNI in an Android application. Compatible with Android 5 (API 21) to Android 14, it showcases a clean and minimal implementation of native-to-Java communication using the NDK, CMake, and Java native methods within MainActivity.
